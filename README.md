Trains
==

This is Andrew Allen's submission to the trains problem given by ThoughtWorks

I wrote this as a ruby library that could easily be packaged into a gem.
This library provides a system for generating useful information for a train network.


To operate, this application you can either include it in a larger project, or you can use the testing suite provided.
The test suite used is rspec and can be executed by running `rspec` in the root folder of the project.

```
    cd $PROJECT_DIRECTORY
    rspec
```
